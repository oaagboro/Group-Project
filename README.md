# Executive Summary



## Identifying and Avoiding Areas At Risk for COVID-19 and Other Natural Disasters         
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 ## Problem Statement
 
 It is critical to mitigate and tame the diffusion of COVID-19 among people. Increased Social distancing is associated with lower rates of COVID- 19.  Providing a navigation tool that will equip people with information in regards to the density of COVID cases, in their vicinity, can potentially decrease the general exposure to COVID-19. Additionally, the navigation tool will provide functionality to view the areas currently affected by wildfires, whether these fires are contained or ongoing so that the user can avoid these areas accordingly.
 
 
 
### Underying Goal 
The underlying goal is to construct an application that locates proximal gas stations within California,upon user request, by mechanism of minimizing exposure to covid hotspots. The application will additionally display location of fires that are ongoing in order to reduce the risk of the user.
